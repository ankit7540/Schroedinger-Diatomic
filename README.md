# Schroedinger-Diatomic

Procedure files written for IgorPro, for the solution of the Schroedinger equation (or the radial nuclear equation) for molecular hydrogen and its isotopes. This scheme uses a known potential curve available as a vector over the inter-nuclear distance.

For actual experiment files (IgorPro .pxp files) for H2 and isotopologues, see repository on zenodo. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4625523"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4625523.svg" alt="DOI"></a>)

General applicability: With a known electronic potential function ( over the inter-nuclear distance) solutions for the rovibrational states (i.e. energies and the corresponding wavefunctions) can be obtained. This was tested with the case of O2.
