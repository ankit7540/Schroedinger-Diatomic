# Schroedinger-Diatomic

Data files for IgorPro, for the solution of the Schroedinger equation (or the radial nuclear equation) for molecular hydrogen and its isotopes. This scheme uses a known potential curve available as a vector over the inter-nuclear distance. Three IgorPro's experiment files (*.pxp) are for the solutions for H2, HD and D2.

In the experiment files (*.pxp), the potential curve used from the work of L. Wolniewicz [ J. Chem. Phys. 99, 1851 (1993) ]. See published works from this research in the following reports:

    A. Raj, H. Hamaguchi, and H. A. Witek, J. Chem. Phys. 148, 104308 (2018).
    A. Raj, H. A. Witek, and H. Hamaguchi, Mol. Phys. 118, e1632950 (2020).

Additional files for the case of H2 include cases for symmetric Hamiltonian matrix.

General applicability: With a known electronic potential function ( over the inter-nuclear distance) solutions for the rovibrational states (i.e. energies and the corresponding wavefunctions) can be obtained. This was tested with the case of O2.
